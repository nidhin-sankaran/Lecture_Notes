## Basic AND XOR OR Properties

### Basic AND Properties
1. **Even/Odd Number**
In binary representation, if a number is even, then its least significant bit (LSB) is 0. 
Conversely, if a number is odd, then its LSB is 1. 

    * **A & 1 = 1** (if A is odd)
        ```cpp
        181 = 10110101 //181 is odd, therefore LSB is 1

        10110101 & 1 = 1 // Performing Bitwise AND Operation

        Since, 181 is odd, Bitwise AND with 1 gave 1.
        ```
    * **A & 1 = 0** (if A is even)
        ```cpp
        180 = 10110100 //180 is even, therefore LSB is 0

        10110100 & 1 = 0 // Performing Bitwise AND Operation

        Since, 180 is even, Bitwise AND with 1 gave 0.
        ```
2. **A & 0 = 0** (for all values of A)
3. **A & A = A** (for all values of A)

### Basic OR Properties
1. **A | 0 = A** (for all values of A)
2. **A | A = A** (for all values of A)

### Basic XOR Properties
1. **A ^ 0 = A** (for all values of A)
2. **A ^ A = 0** (for all values of A)

### Commutative Property
The order of the operands does not affect the result of a bitwise operation. 

```cpp
A & B = B & A // Bitwise AND
A | B = B | A // Bitwise OR
A ^ B = B ^ A // Bitwise XOR
```

### Associative Property
* It states that the grouping of operands does not affect the result of the operation. 
* In other words, if we have three or more operands that we want to combine using a bitwise operation, we can group them in any way we want, and the final result will be the same.

```cpp
(A & B) & C = A & (B & C) // Bitwise AND
(A | B) | C = A | (B | C) // Bitwise OR
(A ^ B) ^ C = A ^ (B ^ C) // Bitwise XOR
```

### Question

Evaluate the expression: a ^ b ^ a ^ d ^ b

### Choices

- [ ] a ^ b ^ a ^ b
- [ ] b
- [ ] b ^ d
- [x] d

### Explanation

We can evaluate the expression as follows:
```cpp
a ^ b ^ a ^ d ^ b = (a ^ a) ^ (b ^ b) ^ d // grouping the a's and the b's
= 0 ^ 0 ^ d // since a ^ a and b ^ b are both 0
= d // the result is d
```
Therefore, the expression a ^ b ^ a ^ d ^ b simplifies to d.

---

### Question

Evaluate the expression: 1 ^ 3 ^ 5 ^ 3 ^ 2 ^ 1 ^ 5

### Choices

- [ ] 5
- [ ] 3
- [x] 2
- [ ] 1

###  Explanation

We can evaluate the expression as follows:
```cpp
// grouping the pairs of equal values and XORing them
1 ^ 3 ^ 5 ^ 3 ^ 2 ^ 1 ^ 5 = ((1 ^ 1) ^ (3 ^ 3) ^ (5 ^ 5)) ^ 2 
= (0 ^ 0 ^ 0) ^ 2 // since x ^ x is always 0
= 0 ^ 2 // since 0 ^ y is always y
= 2 // the result is 2
```
Therefore, the expression 1 ^ 3 ^ 5 ^ 3 ^ 2 ^ 1 ^ 5 simplifies to 2.

## Left Shift Operator


### Left Shift Operator (<<)
* The left shift operator (<<) shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions.
* The left shift operator can be used to multiply a number by 2 raised to the power of the specified number of positions.

Example: a = 10 
Let's see a dry run on smaller bit representation(say 8)
Binary Representation of 10 in 8 bits: 00001010
```cpp
(a << 0) = 00001010 = 10
(a << 1) = 00010100 = 20  (mutiplied by 2)
(a << 2) = 00101000 = 40  (mutiplied by 2)
(a << 3) = 01010000 = 80  (mutiplied by 2)
(a << 4) = 10100000 = 160 (mutiplied by 2)
(a << 5) = 01000000 = 64  (overflow, significant bit is lost)
``` 

In general, it can be formulated as:
```cpp
a << n = a * 2^n
1 << n = 2^n
```
However, it's important to note that left shifting a number beyond the bit capacity of its data type can cause an **overflow** condition. 

In above case, if we shift the number 10 more than 4 positions to the left an overflow will occur.


```cpp
(a << 5) = 01000000 = 64 
//(incorrect ans due to overflow)
// correct was 320 but it is too large to get stored in 8 bits
```

**Note:** We can increase the number of bits, but after a certain point it will reach limit and overflow will occur.

---
## Right Shift Operator

### Right Shift Operator (>>)
* The right shift operator (>>) shifts the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of positions. 
* When we right shift a binary number, the most significant bit (the leftmost bit) is filled with 0.
* Right shift operator can also be used for division by powers of 2.

Letâ€™s take the example of the number 20, which is represented in binary as 00010100. Lets suppose, it can be represented just by 8 bits.
```cpp
(a >> 0) = 00010100 = 20
(a >> 1) = 00001010 = 10 (divided by 2)
(a >> 2) = 00000101 = 5  (divided by 2)
(a >> 3) = 00000010 = 2  (divided by 2)
(a >> 4) = 00000001 = 1  (divided by 2)
(a >> 5) = 00000000 = 0  (divided by 2)
```
In general, it can be formulated as:
```cpp
a >> n = a/2^n
1 >> n = 1/2^n
```
Here, overflow condition doesn't arise.

### Question

What will we get if we do 1 << 3 ?

### Choices

- [ ] 1
- [x] 8
- [ ] 3
- [ ] 4

## Power of Left Shift Operator

Let's see how left shift operator can be used in combination with other operators like (OR, AND, XOR) to set, unset, check or toggle an ith bit.


---
## SET ith bit

**Left Shift Operator** can be used with the **OR** operator to **SET** the **i<sup>th</sup>** bit in the number.

```
N = (N | (1<<i))
```
It will SET the **i<sup>th</sup>** bit if it is UNSET else there is no change.

### Example

<img src="https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/063/167/original/or_operator.png?1706037170" width=500/>

---
## TOGGLE ith bit

**Left Shift Operator** can be used with the **XOR** operator to **FLIP(or TOGGLE)** the **i<sup>th</sup>** bit in the number.

```
N = (N ^ (1<<i))
```
After applying the operation, if the **i<sup>th</sup>** bit is SET, then it will be UNSET or vice-versa.

### Example
<img src="https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/063/165/original/xor_operator.png?1706037082" width=500/>

---
## UNSET ith bit


### Example

Suppose we have a number ```N = 6```
Binary Representation of 6:
```
1 1 0 0
```
We have to unset its 2nd bit

```
1 0 0 0
```

### Approach 

First of all, we can check if the bit is set or not by taking & with 1.

```
X = (N & (1<<i))
```
Then, we have two condition:
* if X > 0, it means the **i<sup>th</sup>** bit is SET. To UNSET that bit do:
`N = (N ^ (1<<i))` {XOR with 1 toggles the bit}

* else if it is UNSET, no need to do anything.

### Pseudocode
```cpp
Function unsetbit(N, i){
    X = (N & (1<<i));
    if(checkbit(N,i)){
        N = (N ^ (1<<i));
    }
}
```
### Complexity 
**Time Complexity** - O(1)
**Space Complexity** - O(1)

---
## CHECK ith bit whether it is set or unset


Taking **AND with 1** can help us. 
0 & 1 = 0 
1 & 1 = 1

1. We can shift 1 to the ith bit.
2. If `X = (N & (1<<i))`
    * if X > 0, then **i<sup>th</sup>** bit is set.
    * else **i<sup>th</sup>** bit is not set.

### Example
Suppose we have 
```
N = 45
i = 2
```
The binary representation of 45 is:
```
1 0 1 1 0 1
```
The binary representation of (1<<2) is:
```
0 0 0 1 0 0
```

45 & (1<<2) is 
```
0 0 0 1 0 0
```

It is greater than 0. Hence **i<sup>th</sup>** bit is SET.

### Pseudocode
```cpp
function checkbit(N, i){
    if(N & (1<<i)){
        return true;
    }
    else{
        return false;
    }
}
```

### Complexity 
**Time Complexity** - O(1).
**Space Complexity** - O(1).

## Problem 1 Count the total number of SET bits in N


Given an integer **N**, count the total number of SET bits in **N**.

### Input
```
N = 12
```
### Output
```
2
```

### Approach 1
Iterate over all the bits of integer(which is maximum 32) and check whether that bit is set or not. If it is set then increment the answer(initially 0).
```cpp
function countbit(N){
    ans = 0;
    for(i -> 0 to 31){
        if(checkbit(N, i)){
            ans = ans + 1;
        }
    }
    return ans;
}
```

Here, checkbit function is used to check whether the **i<sup>th</sup>** bit is set or not.

### Approach 2
To count the number of SET bits in a number, we can use a Right Shift operator as: 

* Initialize a count variable to zero.
* While the number is not equal to zero, do the following:
    * Increment the count variable if the **0<sup>th</sup>** bit of the number is 1.
    * Shift the number one bit to the right.
    * Repeat steps a and b until the number becomes zero.
* Return the count variable.

```cpp
function countbit(N){
    ans = 0;
    while(N > 0){
        if(N & 1){
            ans = ans + 1;
        }
        N = (N >> 1);
    }
    return ans;
}
```

---

### Question

What is the time complexity to count the set bits ?

### Choices

- [x] O(log N)
- [ ] O(N) 
- [ ] O(N^2)
- [ ] O(1)

---


### Explanation 

O(log(N)), where 'N' is the value of the given number. 

Since there are log(N) bits in a number and we are going through all the bits one by one, the time complexity of this approach is O(log(N)).

* **Time Complexity** - O(log(N)) 
* **Space Complexity** - O(1)

## Problem 2 Real Life Application - IRCTCs most frequent train search


### Scenerio
**IRCTC (India's train ticketing system)** wants to improve how it shows train options to its users. They've decided that trains which run more **frequently** should appear higher up in the search results. To figure this out, they look at a **28-day period** to see how often each train runs.

### Problem
For **each** train, they've come up with a **special number**. This isn't just any number, though. If you were to write it down in binary form (which is like a special code of $0$s and $1$s), each of the **$28$ digits** corresponds to a day in that **period**. A  **â€˜1â€™**  means the train runs on that day, and a  **â€˜0â€™**  means it doesn't.

### Task
Your task is to help **IRCTC** by writing a program. Given a list **A** of these **special numbers** for different **trains**, your program should find the train that runs the most.


### Examples
**Input 1 :** **A =** $[4369, 8738, 349525]$

**Output 1 :** $[2]$

**Explanation :** 

| Train No. (Index) | Binary Representation | Count Set bits |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 0  | $0000000000000001000100000001$   | 3    |
| 1 | $0000000000000010001000000010$ | 3 |
| 2 | $0000000101010101010101010101$| 14 |

- Clearly the train which is most frequent is **Train 2**. Therefore the output is $[2]$

**Input 2:** A = $[255, 127, 63]$

**Output 2:** $[0]$

**Explanation :**

| Train No. (Index) | Binary Representation | Count Set bits |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 0  | $0000000000000000000011111111$   | 8    |
| 1 | $0000000000000000000001111111$ | 7 |
| 2 | $0000000000000000000000111111$| 6 |

**Input 3:** A = $[268435455, 134217727, 134217727, 268435455]$

**Output 3:** $[0, 3]$



**Explanation :**

| Train No. (Index) | Binary Representation | Count Set bits |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 0  | $1111111111111111111111111111$   | 28    |
| 1 | $0111111111111111111111111111$ | 27 |
| 2 | $0111111111111111111111111111$| 27 |
| 3 | $1111111111111111111111111111$ | 28 |

- Here both the Trains 0 and 3 run on 28 days, so we output them both.

### Solution
- This problem is just an extension of **count number of set bits in N**
- Assume that you have the function for counting the number of set bits already.
- You just need to call this function multiple times on each element and add those elements to the answer which have largest number of set bits count.

### Pseudocode : 
```cpp=
function findMostFrequentTrains(A):
    # A: list of special numbers representing train frequencies

    # Initialize variables
    maxCount = 0
    result = []

    # Iterate over the list of special numbers
    for i -> 0 to length(A) - 1:
        # Count the number of set bits for the current train
        currentCount = countbit(A[i])
        
        # If current count is greater than maxCount, update maxCount and reset result list
        if currentCount > maxCount:
            maxCount = currentCount
            result = [i]
        # If current count equals maxCount, add the train index to the result list
        else if currentCount == maxCount:
            result.append(i)
    
    return result

```
Time Complexity - O(N)
Space Complexity - O(1)

## Problem 3 SET bits in a RANGE


### Problem Statement

A group of computer scientists is working on a project that involves encoding binary numbers. They need to create a binary number with a specific pattern for their project. The pattern requires A 0's followed by B 1's followed by C 0's. To simplify the process, they need a function that takes A, B, and C as inputs and returns the decimal value of the resulting binary number. Can you help them by writing a function that can solve this problem efficiently?

**Constraints:**
```
0 <= A, B, C <= 20
```

**Example:**
```
A = 4
B = 3
C = 2
```

**Output:**
```
28
```

**Explanation:**
```
The corresnponding binary number is "000011100" whose decimal value is 28.
```

### Solution Explanation:
We can take a number 0 and set the bits from C to B+C-1 (0 based indexing from right)

Say initially we have -

| 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
| --- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- | -------- |
| 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0 |

```
A = 4
B = 3
C = 2
```
It means, we will set the bits from 2( C) to 4(B+C-1) from right

This is how the number will look like finally -

| 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
| -- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- | -------- |
| 0| 0     | 0     | 0     | **1**     | **1**    | **1**     | 0     | 0     |

### How to set a bit ?
We can take OR(|) with (1<<i)

### Pseudocode
```cpp
function solve(A, B, C) {
    ans = 0;
    for(i -> C to B+C - 1) {
        ans = ans | (1 << i);
    }
    return ans;
}
```

**Please NOTE:** We have taken ans as long because A+B+C can go uptil total 60 bits as per constraints which can be stored in long but not in integers.
